PS-Redlobo is a forked Project Strawberry with new upcoming features 
like multilanguage support, with a Joomla 7 bridge, a brand new template 
and such, aimed to be the main Redlobo.net multimedia archive.

WHAT IS IT:	I started kicking around the idea of building a new
online image gallery / social thingie to replace FA after the
demise of the Ferrox project. The idea behind PS was to create a site 
mostly feature compatible with FA and once that was done, add 
features from there.

STATUS:		When I first started putting code down I wasn't 
really expecting to write a full site but after about 2 months of 
working in my free time I had a mostly functioning site. These still 
a lot to do. Admin interface, security stuff, tons of small features, 
BUGS, but mostly the core functionality is there. Things like 
uploading, galleries, journals, shouts, comments, notes, most of the 
watchstream.

		I'm taking a small break from development while I 
work on some stuff that'll make me some IRL chedda, but I do plan to 
continue development once I get some more free time. For now, I'm 
throwing this code up here, see if anyone want to help or do 
anything with the code. Released Under the GNU GPL and all that good 
stuff. I just ask for credit where credit is due if you do end up 
using this for anything. Speaking of which, Shouts to Eevee for the 
basic html design that I stole from the Ferrox project so I could get 
started quickly.

There is a beta site and bug tracker up at projectstrawberry.com
